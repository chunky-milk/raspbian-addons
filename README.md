The Raspberry Pi is a great and capable little computer, but it's frustrating how limited and outdated its repositories are! While some software does work, other software either is extremely outdated or just may not work at all. This repository aims to fix that!

Raspbian Addons includes several useful software packages, including but not limited to:
- WebCord, an open-source Discord client
- GitHub Desktop
- VSCodium, privacy-based Visual Studio Code
- The latest version of Java (currently temurin-17-hotspot)
- XSnow and XPenguins, to animate penguins flying around your desktop!
- Several unique emoji fonts
- Microsoft .NET 6.0 (`dotnet-sdk-6.0`)
- And more!

### Would you like to help?

If you'd like to help me with this, contact me! Maintaining a Debian repository isn't easy work! Send me an issue report with your software request, and I can add it for you.

Old repository archive: An older backup of the repository is [here](https://archive.org/download/old-repo-archive/old-repo-archive.zip). It is fully functional and is there in case the existing repository becomes broken and unusable.

### Special Thanks

Thanks to [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org/) for providing VPS services for the repository, and to OSDN and SourceForge for the [mirrors](https://github.com/raspbian-addons/mirrors)! Raspbian Addons would not be possible without these services.
